Each csv is an export from the ActiLife processing program, reducing ActiGraph data to the minute level.
Starting on line 11, columns are as follows
Axis1, Axis2, Axis3, Steps, Lux, InclinometerOff, InclinometerStanding, InclinometerSitting, InclinometerLying
where
Axis1 is the sum of "counts" on the x-axis during the minute
Axis2 is the sum of "counts" on the y-axis during the minute
Axis3 is the sum of "counts" on the z-axis during the minute
Steps is the sum of steps counted during that minute
Lux is the mean luminosity sensed by a photoresistor
InclinometerOff is the number of seconds in the minute that the inclinometer indicated the ActiGraph was not worn
InclinometerStanding is the number of seconds in the minute where the inclinometer indicated the subect was standing
InclinometerSitting is the number of seconds in the minute where the inclinometer indicated the subect was sitting
InclinometerLying is the number of seconds in the minute where the inclinometer indicated the subect was lying down

While not reported in this file, it's common to take the root mean square of the x, y, and z axis to find the total magnitude.
