    "Object-Oriented (OO) is a programming paradigm in which different \"components\" of your software are modeled based on real-world objects. An object is anything that has some characteristics and can perform a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "OO basically relies in abstraction concept, by defining **classes** of **objects** in the software level, which can be represented by the object's data (attributes) and \"code\" (actions they can perform)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** can be defined as a \"blueprint\" of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to make the code easier to maintain, by modularizing and creating better representations of real things.\n",

    "Other example of class would be **Person**, which would have different attributes, like: birth_date, gender, height, weight, city_of_birth, hair_color. a **Person** can also perform some actions like: exercise (which may change their weight), sleep, work, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining how a real-world object may be represented in a software requires **abstraction**. Abstraction is the process of understanding which characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) are relevant to the context and which ones can be ignored. For example, if our program concerns about a person's health, then perhaps their sleep time and exercises are relevant. However, if the program concerns about their financial health, then the sleep time and exercises can be ignored, given space to expenditures and income instead.\n",
